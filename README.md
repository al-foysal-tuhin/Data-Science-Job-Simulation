# Data-Science-Job-Simulation

## Project: Data Science Job Simulation (Forage)
**Key Features & Skills**

**Web Scraping & Data Acquisition:** Developed a Python script using Beautiful Soup/Scrapy to scrape public company data (e.g., industry, founding year, key personnel) from a target website.

**Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, outliers, and data type conversions to prepare scraped and provided datasets for model training.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed statistical analysis and visualization (e.g., histograms, correlation matrices) to uncover patterns and relationships in customer data.

**Predictive Modeling:** Built and evaluated classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict customer buying behavior (binary classification).

**Model Evaluation:** Used key metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC to assess model performance and select the optimal algorithm.

**Business Insights:** Translated model results and web scraping findings into actionable recommendations for the marketing or sales team.

## Project Breakdown

**1. Web Scraping for Company Insights**
   
 * **Goal:** Gather supplementary, real-time data on potential clients to enrich the existing customer database.

 * **Tools Used:** Python, requests, BeautifulSoup (or other scraping library).

 * **Output:** A clean CSV file of company profiles ready for merging with the main dataset.
   

**2. Predicting Customer Buying Behaviour**
   
 * **Goal:** Develop a model to predict which customers are most likely to convert after a promotional campaign.

 * **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

 * **Methodology:** Followed a standard Machine Learning pipeline: Data Ingestion $\rightarrow$ EDA $\rightarrow$ Feature Engineering $\rightarrow$ Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning $\rightarrow$ Final Model Selection.
