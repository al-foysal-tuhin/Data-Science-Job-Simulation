# Data-Science-Job-Simulation

## Project: Data Science Job Simulation (Forage)
**Key Features & Skills**

**Web Scraping & Data Acquisition:** Developed a Python script using Beautiful Soup/Scrapy to scrape public company data (e.g., industry, founding year, key personnel) from a target website.

**Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, outliers, and data type conversions to prepare scraped and provided datasets for model training.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed statistical analysis and visualization (e.g., histograms, correlation matrices) to uncover patterns and relationships in customer data.

**Predictive Modeling:** Built and evaluated classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict customer buying behavior (binary classification).

**Model Evaluation:** Used key metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC to assess model performance and select the optimal algorithm.

**Business Insights:** Translated model results and web scraping findings into actionable recommendations for the marketing or sales team.
